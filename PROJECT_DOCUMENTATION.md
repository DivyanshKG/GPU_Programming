# Connect 4 GPU Game - Project Documentation

## Project Overview

This project implements a Connect 4 game where two different GPU strategies compete against each other. The game demonstrates parallel computing concepts using CUDA and provides a complete framework for GPU-based game AI.

- **Performance**: Fast execution, deterministic results

#### GPU 2: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
- **Algorithm**: Random playout simulation
- **Features**:
  - Simulates thousands of random games
  - Balances exploration and exploitation
  - Adapts strategy based on win rates
  - Non-deterministic but robust
- **CUDA Implementation**: Parallel simulation of multiple playouts
- **Performance**: Slower but more sophisticated decision making
